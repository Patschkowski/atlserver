# ATL Server

ATL Server is a technology originally developed by Microsoft for developing web-based applications based on IIS 6. In particular it marks the transition for DCOM objects to offer its services via SOAP as well.

For the latter the technology relied on special compiler extensions that long ago have been removed from Visual Studio.

This is a clone from the original source release on CodePlex with improvements to make the technology compile on Visual Studio 2017.
